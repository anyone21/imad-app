        My name isujjjwal bansal . why is this code not working! Damn! What should I do now? 
        Hope my code doesn't break on live, take care Pratik. It's old code, this function is
        used at 1583 places, making change in it is like awakening a sleeping monster! There 
        are too many bugs reported by Software testers. Are these people born to find defect 
        in everything they see? Fight with testers with my full capacity only to realize in the
        end its a bug, and I will have to solve it. :P . Then comes writing Unit test-cases, Code
        review by senior Technical Architect(s).

        We shall say that an n-digit number is pandigital if it makes use of all the digits 1 to n exactly
        once; for example, the 5-digit number, 15234, is 1 through 5 pandigital.The product 7254 is unusual,
        as the identity, 39 Ã— 186 = 7254, containing multiplicand, multiplier, and product is 1 through 9 
        pandigital.Find the sum of all products whose multiplicand/multiplier/product identity can be written
        as a 1 through 9 pandigit
