        My name isujjjwal bansal . why is this code not working! Damn! What should I do now? 
        Hope my code doesn't break on live, take care Pratik. It's old code, this function is
        used at 1583 places, making change in it is like awakening a sleeping monster!

        <P>
        We shall say that an n-digit number is pandigital if it makes use of all the digits 1 to n exactly
        once; for example, the 5-digit number, 15234, is 1 through 5 pandigital.
